# Introduction
We present modelled greenhouse gas emissions for different land uses in rural UK.
Rural areas were based on land use archetypes (Young and Thomson, 2023).

Someone else had previously done some studies in this region but not for these archetypes (Goodwin et al., 2022).

We are going to do something different and actually calculate some greenhouse gas emissions using our models.

# Simulations
We ran some simulations of greehouse gas fluxes in the archetypes.

# Methodology
Used the LULUCF inventory models. (LULUCF, 2023)

# Results
The Greenhouse Gas emissions are very interesting.

# Figures
Figures go in here.

#Conclusions
This is really great work looking at greenhouse gas emissions in land use archetypes.
